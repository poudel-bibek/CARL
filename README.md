- Setup [SUMO versio 1.15.0](https://github.com/eclipse-sumo/sumo/releases/tag/v1_15_0)
- Clone this repository
- Use the following commands to complete setup.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate flow
python setup.py develop
pip install -U pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Part 1: Training the Imitation Learning model on I24 Motion dataset
  - For the data processing (car-following filter), follow the Notebook: [Car-Following trajectory analysis](https://github.com/poudel-bibek/CARL/blob/master/car_following/Car-Following%20trajectory%20analysis.ipynb)
  - Follow the Notebook: [Imitation Learning](https://github.com/poudel-bibek/CARL/blob/master/imitation_learning/Imitation%20Learning-1.ipynb)
  

---
### Part 2: Training the Congestion Stage Classifier

- Follow the Notebook: [Ring](https://github.com/poudel-bibek/Imitation_Congestion/blob/master/ring/Ours/CSC_training_ring.ipynb)

If you want to use the trained CSCs, see `Data` section below. 

---
### Part 3: Training RL based RVs

Go to the folder `ring/Ours` and enter the command:

```
# Train our policy in Ring (at 5% penetration) 
python train.py singleagent_ring

# Train our policy in Ring (at penetrations >5%)
python train.py multiagent_ring

```

---
### Part 4: Generate rollouts for RL based RVs or Heuristic and Model based RVs and save as csv files.
All scripts related to this part are consolidated in the Notebook: [Evaluate Ring](https://github.com/poudel-bibek/CARL/blob/master/ring/Evaluate%20Ring.ipynb)

#### I. RL based RVs:

Replace the method name to be one of: ours, wu

```
python test_rllib.py [Location of trained policy] [checkpoint number] --method wu --gen_emission --num_rollouts [no_of_rollouts] --shock --render --length 260
```

#### II. Heuristic and Model based RVs:
For all (replace the method_name to be one of: bcm, lacc, piws, fs, idm)

```
python classic.py --method [method_name] --render --length 260 --num_rollouts [no_of_rollouts] --shock --gen_emission
```
For stability tests where a standard perturbation is applied by a leading HV, include --stability to the line above

---
### Part 5: Evaluate the generated rollouts

To evaluate the generated rollouts into Safety and Efficiency metrics, replace the method name to be one of: `idm`, `bcm`, `fs`, `piws`, `lacc`, `wu`, `ours`.

```
python eval_metrics.py --method [method_name] --num_rollouts [no_of_rollouts]
```

To add plots to the metrics, include --save_plots

For Stability plots

```
python eval_plots.py --method [method_name]
```
